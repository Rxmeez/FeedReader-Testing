# Feed Reader Testing
---
In this Udacity project, I worked with Jasmine development framework by applying to a project given by Udacity. This project has introduced me to the concept of 'Test driven development' (TDD) where test suites are created first, then the application is made. This helps to create robust application as we must pass all test, as well as reduces time to manually check for errors. Using this approach we can monitor that any future addition to the application wont break the past feature, if they do it will alert, that application has failed.

### Different Test Carried Out
---
1. RSS Feeds:
* Test feeds are defined
* Test feed URLs are defined and contain content
* Test feed names are defined and contain content

2. Menu:
* Test is hidden on page load
* Test menu icon appears on click

3. First RSS Entry:
* Test at least one entry displays on load after async call

4. RSS Entry Change:
* Test RSS entry changes on menu select
